    "The `Polygon` class stores a polygon object is two ways.  First, as a collection of vertices, `pts`.  This is not a terribly helpful representation, mathematically speaking, and is useful mostly for visualizing the object.  The second representation is the normal-distance representation of the sides of the polygon.  The is a mathematially useful object.  If $G$ is an $n\\times2$ matrix of vor-vector normals $G_i$ of the polygon faces, and $m$ is a length-$n$ vector of distances, then the point $z\\in\\mathbb R^2$ is inside the polygon if:\n",
