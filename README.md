# Polygons

Package to define and manipulate poylgons, particularly when computing value sets for game-theoretic problems.  Please see [tutorial](nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/squipbar/Polygons.jl/blob/master/Tutorial.ipynb) for an extended example of how to use the package.

## Set up
Currently the package is not available through the Julia package distribution system. To download and use the package, run the following from the command line:

```sh
    cd ~/.julia/v0.x/
    git clone git@github.com:squipbar/Polygons.jl.git
```
Where ~ is your home directory, and v0.x is the version of julia that you are using.
